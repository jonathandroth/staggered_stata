## Description
The staggered_stata package is a Stata implementation of the [staggered](https://github.com/jonathandroth/staggered) R package, which implements the efficient estimator proposed in [Roth and Sant'Anna (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01291.pdf) as well as the difference-in-differences estimators of [Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303948?dgcid=author) and [Sun and Abraham (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440762030378X) for settings with staggered treatment timing. See the [staggered documentation](https://github.com/jonathandroth/staggered) for more details, including [examples](https://github.com/jonathandroth/staggered#stata-implementation) of Stata use.
